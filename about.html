           <h1> About </h1> 
           <a href="index.html">Index </a>
           <p>I mostly stick to the simple CSS template shown to us in the tutorial for the layout of the Index page, as well as the navigation bar CSS.</p>
           <p>The image descriptions are done using the figcaption element. I added paragraph breaks between each so that the layout looks less cluttered.</p>
           <p>Each caption consists of my own rough English translation of the chapter title, combined with the original Chinese title for quick reference.</p>
           <p>I took screenshots using the PrtSc tool on my laptop, because in the PDF Scans, each "page" has two illustrations on it side by side, so I have to screenshot the individual illustration manually.</p>
           <p>The earliest known printed edition of <i>Fengshen Yanyi</i> is the Shu edition published during the reign of Emperor Wanli.</p>
           <p>The original physical copy is currently perserved in the National Archive of Japan.</p> 
           <p><a href="https://www.shuge.org/">Shuge.org</a>, a non-profit digital archive for old Chinese books, calligraphy, and paintings(linked in the Index page), likely downloaded the PDFs from the digital archive of the National Archive of Japan. <a href="https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/das/meta/F1000000000000107715.html">Here is the link to the NAoJ page.</a></p>
           <p>Having been published 500+ years ago, the novel is well within Public Domain.</p>
           <p>The scans on the NAoJ website are divided into 20 volumes, just like the physical books. The Shuge version seems to have combined several volumes together into a total of 4 large PDFs.</p>
           <p>Either way, all the woodblock print illustrations are collected in Volume 1, at the very beginning of the book.</p>
